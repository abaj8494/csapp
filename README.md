# Welcome

This is the recommended textbook for COMP1521 at UNSW.

I did not touch this textbook when I took the course. I wish I had.

I've come to value this textbook as a computer scientist now. It peels back the layers behind your C code and shows you why it all works. 

# Usage

~~I am not diligently working through these exercises. I read the textbook during my lunch breaks and so this repo is only a sandbox.~~

This textbook is now consuming me. I study it diligently and work through the examples. It is fantastically written and everything makes sense.
